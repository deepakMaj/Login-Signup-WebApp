# Login-Signup-WebApp
It is a simple non-spring mvc login and signup web application using Tomcat server,MySQL and java code

This project simply focuses on implementing MVC framework(Model-View-Controller) especially for java beginners for 
understanding JSP(Java-Server-Pages) and servlets and working with database MySQL.
I have implemeted Tomcat Connection Pooling which is minimizing effort of making new connection again and again with hefty code.
I have uploaded all files required for project to run on the fly.
*Note* -->  In META-INF/context.xml changes are to be made !! 
1 Change username and password to your MySQL connection username and password
2 Also change the url connection for your workbench
I have also added login-webapp.sql file to generate database and table, have a look at it.


Build a Web-Devlopment project in your IDE and try to understand it.
